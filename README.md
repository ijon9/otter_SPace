Our first dip into the world of Processing

## Updated Summary of Action

- First, we reviewed basic Processing commands and discovered that draw() was repeated continuously
- We then reviewed classes in Processing and created the Ball class to assign a color, speed and other attributes to every newly created Ball
- To simulate bouncing off the edge of the screen (hw53), Ball's move function was modified to reverse a ball's velocity when it reached the end of the screen (size 600 x 600). The greatest difficulty in this phase was thinking through what the draw() function in Chain_Reacts should do and what should be contained in the each ball's move().
- After establishing ball movement, we then moved on to working on growing, shrinking, and collisions (hw 54). For this phase of the lab we relied heavily on the QAF post about how to tell whether two balls were in contact. Also important was the concept of phases and clearly denoting whether a ball was shrinking or growing.

- As of 5/26, lab is complete
